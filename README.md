# Vivaldi_Mods 
What is Vivaldi? A [new browser](https://vivaldi.com) launched several years ago based on Blink (a great engine) to be the spirtual successor of Opera [Presto] which development was halted.
Where all browser now tends to look alike the same, Vivaldi point to be unique.

In this small repo I'll list the mods I currently use on Vivaldi Browser but before doing anything please READ the [help](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi?page=1) guide.

# Custom.css Readme
The code is usually updated on Vivaldi Snapshot when it reaches [Release Candidate](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/83/desktop-snapshots) status (RC) so this means the most of the time will work fine with the [Vivaldi Stable](https://vivaldi.com/download/) too.

The custom.css is tailored around my Vivaldi installation. 
However most the code is meant to be universal. 
Ask to [modding community](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) if you need help.
