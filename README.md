# Readme (please)
### This repo is VERY OLD, you should [head to the new one](https://github.com/Hadden89/Vivaldi_Mods_3.8) but as I still may want to take back something from here I keep it pinned.

# Vivaldi_Mods 
What is Vivaldi? A [new browser](https://vivaldi.com) launched several years ago based on Blink (actually a great engine) to be the spirtual successor of Opera [Presto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(browser_engine)) which development was halted with the acquistion of the company. Why is cool? Where all the browser now tends to look alike the same, Vivaldi point to be unique, is user-centric and has a great developers and community support behind it.

In this small repo I'll list the mods I currently use on Vivaldi Browser but before doing anything please READ the [help](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi?page=1) guide.

# CSS files readme 
The code is usually updated on Vivaldi Snapshot when it reaches [Release Candidate](https://forum.vivaldi.net/search?term=RC&in=titles&matchWords=all&categories%5B%5D=83&sortBy=topic.timestamp&sortDirection=desc&showAs=topics) status (RC) so it should work with latest [Vivaldi Stable](https://vivaldi.com/download/) too.

Few lines are actually tailored around my Vivaldi installation but most code should work with any setup vivaldi installation. Only pick the code you actually need. If in doubt, ask to the great [modding community](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) for help.

I've also started to split my "big" custom.css - which probably will be removed soon - in few "smaller" categorized .css to make easier to keep the code clean :)

# And what about JS mods ?
As I'm really unexperienced when it comes to Javascripts mods, I limit to link most useful mods in a [separated JS readme file](https://github.com/Hadden89/Vivaldi_mods/blob/master/Javascript_mods.md). Enjoy vivaldi and its community. [Join to the forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net) if you didn't that yet ;)
