# Vivaldi_Mods 
What is Vivaldi? A [new browser](https://vivaldi.com) launched several years ago based on Blink (a great engine) to be the spirtual successor of Opera [Presto] which development was halted.
Where all browser now tends to look alike the same, Vivaldi point to be unique.

In this small repo I'll list the mods I currently use on Vivaldi Browser but before doing anything please READ the [help](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi?page=1) guide ;)

# Custom.css Readme
Currently updated on [Vivaldi 3.0 RC3](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/45884/vivaldi-3-0-rc-3-vivaldi-desktop-browser-snapshot-1874-22?page=1)

The custom.css is tailored around my Vivaldi installation. However most the code is meant to be universal. Just take the parts you need.
